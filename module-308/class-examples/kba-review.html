        //the substring function works the same way as Java does
        //remember that the first position is 0
            //  01234567890

        let a= "Hello world";
        console.log(a.substring(4,5));
        console.log("Lastindex = " + a.lastIndexOf("l"));

        //what is z going to print?
        //watch for the ""because that is a string and will not evaluate the math

        let y = 6;
        let z= ("x*y");

        console.log(z);

        //the difference between == and ===
        //not only is it a KBA question but it is important to know also
        //=== compares not only the value but the data type as well

        console.log("1" ==1); //true
        console.log("1" =="1"); // true
        console.log(1==1) //true
        console.log("1" ===1) //false
        console.log(1===1) //true

        //one difference between let and var is you can only define something
        // with using let once in the same code block, with var it will allow more than once
        let abc ="123";
        //let abc = "abc"

        //this line is an error because abc is already defined

        //var will allow more than once in the same code block,
        //also this is bad practice to do this
        var xyz ="123";
        var xyz ="abc";
        console.log(xyz);

        //how to make an alert box in javascript
        //this can be nice for debugging

        //Javascript is a weakly typed language meaning a variable can be of any type
        //and that type can chance

        //Java is a strongly typed language meaning the datatype must be specificied
        //at compile time and cannot change at runtime
        
        //Javascript is a scripting language that is weakly typed

        //FACT! External javascript files CANNOT contain HTML

        //in Javascript we can contatinate strings using the +
        //This is the same as Java

        let str= "Hello" + "World";
        console.log(str);

        //in javascript creating a date is very flexible
        //Java is very strict

        let date1= new Date("Thu Jan 29 2009 17:34:41");
        let date2 = new Date("2024-01-29");

        //getMonth returns a number between 0 and 11
        // it is considering January month to be 0
        console.log("Month =" + date1.getMonth());
        console.log("Month =" + date2.getMonth());
        console.log(date1.getMonth() === date2.getMonth());
        //this will convert the 1st one therefore it will return true

        //in javascript continue works the same as it does in java
        //also break works the same way as it does in java

        for(let i=0; i<5; i++ ){
            if(i==3){
                continue;

        //TRUE Statement : Javascript is "safe" in that the browser does not allow direct access
        //to the memory or the CPU

        //Very common gotcha - this is an every day important thing to know
        let trick = 8 + "8";
        console.log(trick) // answer is 88


        //all 5 of these are important to know

        //getElementsByTagName - find elements in the document by their HTML tag
        //for example find all of the p tags

        //getElementsById - find an element by the id ="" attribute
        //we know that this will return a single element because id is unique

        //getElementsByClassName - finds all elements with the CSS class name

        //getElementsByName - finds all elements with name ="" attribute


        //querySelector - find the first element in the document based on the CSS query
        // this one is the most powerful and most used

        //you cannot subtract a string from a string
        // it is not causing a compile or run error
        //Nan means...not a number

        let q = "Hello" - "World";
        console.log(q);

        //for loops
        let person = {
            firstName : "Eric",
            lastName: "Smith",
            eyeColor: "brown"
        }

        //when we use in it loops over the keys
        // in means loop over the keys
        for (let i in person){
            console.log(i + "=" + person[i]);
        }

        //of is looping over the values of an array
        let array = [1,2,3,4];

        for (let i of person){
            console.log(i);
        }

        // 2 ways of registering an event listener
        // first is using the onclick="functionToRun()" on a html tag like we did in buttonclick.html
        //second is using the addEventListener built into the javascript language. This method is available on lal
        //html elements
// to use the addEventListener function first you have to query the element from the document
//then you can use the addEventListener('click', function());

//TRUE - Array.splice() changes the original array whereas Array.slice() does not.

//308.4 slide #28 talks about creating new HTML elements
// there are 2 ways of creating elements
//document.createElement('p'); this will create a new p tag in the document - can make all tags

//createTextNode() // this only works for text nodes like a p tag

//Javascript trivia about numbers
//number datatype in javascript is either an integer or a float
